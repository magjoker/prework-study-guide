A guide to help out with the pre-work
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My motivation was learning the 4 different languages enough that I can be able to create this guide in the first place. I built this project to help other students and to help myself better understand the functionality of these languages. It worked, at least for me. I learned a lot about the debugging process, which is arduous. I learned how these languages interact with each other and what they can do when they work together. Also what is listed as notes in the study guide.
